This is the repo for the book [Advances in Financial Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Advances-Financial-Machine-Learning-Marcos/dp/1119482089) by De Prado. The book was recommended to me by my good friend Paul Perry.

## Content

The repo will contain all the exercises from the book. The repo is organized by chapter, every chapter is a folder with their own requirements.
Every chapter will have a python notebook for the exercise. The implementation will be contained in a python module in the folder that the notebook will import.

I build the repo in such a way that can be used as a python package, so every chapter can also be seen as a submodule of the python package.
